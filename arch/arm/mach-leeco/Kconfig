	  Once selected, this will apply common Kernel changes

	  * USB Cypress -> USB Type-C
	  * Analogix -> USB Type-C
	  * ATmega48A -> Capacitive Keys
	  * QPNP MHL -> MHL State
	  * MSM I2C Flash -> Camera's Flash

	  This can be used to apply patches from LeEco without touching
	  other devices or the general purpose of the Linux Kernel.

	  If unsure, say N.
