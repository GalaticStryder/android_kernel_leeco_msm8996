config MACH_LEECO
	bool "Kernel support for LeEco devices"
	depends on ARCH_MSM8996
	select USB_CCLOGIC
	select MSM_I2C_FLASH
	select LETVS_CLASS
	default n
	help
	  Once selected, this will apply common Kernel changes
	  from LeEco at all levels. Device specific changes aren't
	  covered, you need to select them manually.

	  The following drivers will be selected in Kernel:

	  * USB CC Logic -> USB Type-C
	  * USB Cypress -> USB Type-C
	  * MSM I2C Flash -> Camera's Flash
	  * LeTV Class -> Probe Helper

	  This can be used to apply patches from LeEco without touching
	  other devices or the general purpose of the Linux Kernel.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MACH_LEECO_OEM
	depends on MACH_LEECO
	bool "OEM extensions for LeEco devices"
	help
	  Once selected, this option will bring-in OEM changes in Kernel source code, they
	  aren't usually needed.

	  If unsure, say Y here to avoid issues when running stock Android firmware. Otherwise,
	  say N.

config MACH_LEECO_DEBUG
	depends on MACH_LEECO
	bool "Debugging conditionals for LeEco devices"
	help
	  Once selected, this option will enable most OEM debugging code in Kernel, this is
	  not needed unless you're debugging changes on those OEM drivers.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MACH_LEECO_PD
	depends on MACH_LEECO
	select USB_CYCCG
	bool "Support USB PD control protocol for LeEco devices"
	help
	  Once selected, this option will enable support for LeEco's PD infrastructure. This
	  new USB infrastructure is a dependency for some USB controllers like the ANX7418,
	  it will be available as 'le_ab' power supply type in SMB charger interface.

	  This will select the CYCCG USB driver as a dependency to poll temperature from the
	  USB controller.

	  If unsure, say N.

config MACH_LEECO_X2
	tristate
	depends on MACH_LEECO
	select ANALOGIX_OHIO
	# Not ready!

config MACH_LEECO_ZL1
	bool "Kernel support for the Le Pro 3 (ZL1)"
	depends on MACH_LEECO
	select BACKLIGHT_LM3697

	select USB_CCLOGIC_PER30216
	select USB_CCLOGIC_TUSB320
	help
	  Once selected, barebones Le Pro 3 tuning and drivers will take effect.

	  The following drivers will be selected in Kernel:

	  * LM3697 -> Backlight
	  * Goodix 5208 -> Fingerprint Sensor
	  * Focaltech FTS -> Touchsreen
	  * TI DRV2604L -> Vibrator
	  * MAXQ616 -> Infrared Remote Control
	  * Maxim MAX98927 -> Smart PA
	  * Custom ZL1 MBHC -> Audio Socket
	  * PN544 -> NFC
	  * Pericom 30216C -> USB Type-C
	  * Texas Instruments TUSB320 -> USB Type-C Audio

	  OEM changes such as custom init, cpufreq modifications, VR support and proprietary
	  sound controllers aren't covered in this option.
	  Thus, if you want those OEM changes you'll need to select the next
	  option right down below.

	  If unsure, you're the expert. Otherwise, always say N.

config MACH_LEECO_ZL1_OEM
	depends on MACH_LEECO_ZL1
	bool "OEM extensions for the Le Pro 3 (ZL1)"
	help
	  Once selected, this option will bring-in OEM changes in Kernel source code, they
	  aren't usually needed.

	  If unsure, say Y here to avoid issues when running stock Android firmware. Otherwise,
	  say N.
